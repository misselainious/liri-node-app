**What the project does:
This app takes in one of 4 commands: concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this or do-what-it-says
and an argument from the user: band name, song title, movie title
and returns information about the media.

The do-what-it-says function is a stand alone function that calls the text in the random.txt file and runs the specified command and argument without any needed user input.

**Why the project is useful:
This is a quick way to find out useful information on a variety of topics using the most current data available through API's.

*How users can get started with the project:
Type "node liri" and then one of the 4 commands and your media query of choice!
